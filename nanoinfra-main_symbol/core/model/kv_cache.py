"""
Key/value caches for autoregressive decoding.

    KVCache        the ordinary one. Returns a GROWING slice of its buffers, so the
                   shape itself says how much is valid. Right for anything that is not
                   chasing per-token latency.

    StaticKVCache  every shape and every address fixed across steps, which is what
                   CUDA graphs require. Costs an attention mask; buys the replay of a
                   recorded launch sequence instead of re-launching every kernel. At
                   batch-1 decode that is most of the time — measured 3.5x on a 12-layer
                   768-dim model.

KVCache implements the contract core/model/gpt.py speaks (CausalSelfAttention.forward):
    get_pos()                  -> #tokens already cached (the trunk reads this ONCE
                                  per forward, before the block loop, as its rotary
                                  offset)
    insert_kv(layer_idx, k, v) -> the full cached view so far [B, n_kv_head, pos+T, hd]

Within one trunk forward every layer inserts the same T positions in order
0..n_layer-1, so the position advances exactly once per forward: on the LAST
layer's insert. Buffers are allocated lazily from the first insert's dtype/device
(so the cache follows autocast) .

    """A cache with every shape and address pinned, so CUDA graphs can replay it.

    A graph records one sequence of kernel launches and replays it: same kernels, same
    addresses, same shapes, only the CONTENTS of memory may differ. Three things in the
    ordinary decode path violate that, and each of the three differences below removes
    one:

      1. THE RETURN IS THE WHOLE BUFFER, never a growing slice, and the write position
         is a 0-dim tensor on the GPU advanced in place. A Python int would be baked
         into the recorded graph, so every replay would write to the slot it held at
         record time.
      2. VALIDITY IS A MASK (`attn_mask`) rather than a shrunken k/v. Shapes must be
         fixed; mask CONTENTS may vary, and this one does.
      3. THE ROTARY LOOKUP IS AN index_select on that position tensor. Python slicing
         resolves at trace time — same problem as (1).

    Buffers are allocated eagerly: a lazily allocated one would take a new address on
    the first insert after a reset, and an address is exactly what a graph may not
    change.

    `bidir` switches the mask from causal decode to "every query sees the whole prefix
    plus the current chunk, bidirectionally", which is what a block-diffusion denoise
    step needs. A plain attribute rather than a constructor argument because it changes
    between steps of the same sequence, on the same cache.
